    <h1>CheckInPro Accounts Deletion Policy</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>In CheckInPro, we value user privacy and data security. Our app is designed for employee attendance tracking and HR management, and as such, accounts are created by users and managed by company administrators (HR personnel).</p>
    
    <h2>2. Can Employees Delete Their Accounts?</h2>
    <p>Employees cannot delete their accounts themselves because the system is managed by HR. If you need your account removed, you must contact your HR department.</p>
    
    <h2>3. How to Request Account Deletion</h2>
    <p>If you no longer need access to your account, please follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Contact your HR department or system administrator within your organization.</li>
        <li>If your organization is no longer using our services, your HR team can request deletion by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@nardconcepts.io">info@nardconcepts.io</a></li>
        <li>Once HR processes your request, your account will be removed according to company policies.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>4. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about account deletion, please reach out to your HR department. If your company needs assistance, they can contact us at <a href="mailto:info@nardconcepts.io">info@nardconcepts.io</a>.</p>
